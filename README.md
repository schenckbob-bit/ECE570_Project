# ECE570_Project
ECE570 Project-submission

There are two jupyter notebook files included in this project. These files are intended to be ran in a google colab session,
so that it is easy to recreate my work without installing anything on someone's own computer. All cells should be ran sequentially.

The first jupyter file is Diffusion_With_MNIST.ipynb. This file is used to recreate the exploratory work I did with diffusion
on the MNIST data set. Generated MNIST images will appear in the last cell.

The second jupyter file is Training_and_Generating_Embeddings.ipynb. This file does have one manual interaction in the third cell, 
One will have to upload the ROCStories_winter2018.csv file in that interaction in order to recreate the work I did. Afterwords, all
cells should be able to run sequentially. Generated text will appear in the last cell.

PLEASE NOTE: A very large training time is needed to generate results with any substance
